more data cleanup/corrections
country == USA

still more out-of-country embedded commas

created don't mail and don't contact categories
header: Xno_mail
XC: don't mail - mailing address is out of country
XS: possible don't mail - mailing address is out of state
don't contact if no physical address

created apartment category for possible no physical contact
header: Xno_addr
XA: address is in an apartment building
 basis: 10 or more units at an address
 some will be miscategorized, but if we work on the assumption that
 the apartment buildings we missed cancel the ones that aren't apartments
 then we have a ballpark estimate to start the discussion
XN: there is no local address on file
 Note that there are several people registered at the marina.
 These are either at 1/2 Sea Wall or 0/1 University Ave.
 We didn't flag these.
XD: student housing

Fixed yet more bad data: street address in apartment # field

VOTER ID 2101934 changed from 650 Addison to 651 Addison
Note: someone is registered at 0 Walnut/Vine St. (Peet's Coffee)
