Because the csv file received from the registrar of voters has embedded commas
not only in various data but in three column headers as well, all the data columns
after the "care_of" column had erroneous data that prevented any analysis of
election data, mailing address information, dates, etc. This presented itself in
for example, six extra empty columns at the far right and the resulting
misalignment of proper election history data into inappropriate columns.

We requested instead a tab-separated (tsv) file but this was not forthcoming
so we embarked on cleaning up the registrar's data ourselves. This ended up 
taking a large chunk of our time and involved:
	Reading the registrar's csv file into a spreadsheet (.ods) file, then
	Cleaning the headers (realigning, renaming, deleting unused)
	Cleaning data by manually viewing and adjusting into appropriate columns
	Correcting typos in addresses and other incorrect data

To create a proper .tsv file _after_ making the above spreadsheet changes:
Read the corrected .ods (spreadsheet) file into LibreOffice
Save a Copy... with format .csv
Close the .ods file
Open the .csv file using tab separator (instead of comma) *and* check "trim spaces"
Save a copy renamed to .tsv)

The csv file from the registrar of voters has no district information,
only precincts. In order to map precincts to districts we did the following:

Downloaded three Berkeley district maps from city open data site:
Berkeley-City-Council-Districts.pdf
Berkeley-Voting-Precincts-Map.pdf
CouncilDistrictsE_2018.pdf for historical reference (precinct redistribution)

Manually cross-referenced precincts to districts to create a "district" field in the data
The maps are filed in the "maps" subdirectory.

Requested and received legend information from registrar of voters
This explains the A N V etc codes in the csv file.
"HISTORY CODE FOR VOTER HISTORY-2023.pdf"

Found more data cleanup/corrections
country == USA
city == Albany or Oakland for Berkeley addresses
still more out-of-country embedded commas or other issues
Made sure that all out-of-country mailing addresses now have their country in the
  mail_country field.

Downloaded previous election returns from the registrar of voters:
District 5 2016 and 2020
nov-8-2016-comprehensive-results-report-councilmember-dist5.pdf
District5.2020.results.png
District5.ballots.returned.png
(Note that the registrar of voters mischaracterizes the districts
for the ballots-returned data i.e., district 2, 3, and 5 are labeled 3, 4, and 6)

Downloaded voter information files from the registrar of voters:
c001_g22_registration_by_g22_block20.csv
c001_g22_registration_by_g22_srprec.csv
c001_g22_sr_blk_map.csv
c001_g22_voters_by_g22_block20.csv
These files have rather cryptically-encoded demographic information about voters.
NGP VAN will have these fields internally, but it might be possible to extract
the information from these files if necessary.

##############################################################################
### Creation of new fields for analysis (described below this comment).
District
Xreg_at
Xmail_to
##############################################################################

Created don't mail and don't contact categories
The out-of-country addresses may be in one of these categories:
	foreign students residing in Berkeley
	Berkeley residents working or studying overseas
The out-of-state addresses are probably similar.
In either case we probably wouldn't bother sending mail out-of-state or out-of-country.

header: Xmail_to
XC: don't mail - mailing address is out of country
XS: possible don't mail - mailing address is out of state
Don't contact if no physical mailing address

Created apartment category for possible no physical contact
Sophie expressed a desire to exclude apartment buildings from walk lists.

header: Xreg_at
XA: address is in an apartment building
 basis: 10 or more units at an address
 Some will be miscategorized, but if we work on the assumption that
 the apartment buildings we missed cancel the ones that aren't apartments
 then we have a ballpark estimate to start the discussion.
XN: there is no local address on file
 Note that there are several people registered at the marina.
 These are either at 1/2 Sea Wall or 0/1 University Ave.
 We didn't flag these.
XD: student housing: dorms, student groups

Fixed yet more bad data: street address in apartment # field

VOTER ID 2101934: we changed from 650 Addison (doesn't exist) to 651 Addison
Note: someone is registered at 0 Walnut/Vine St. (Peet's Coffee)
There are several people (assumed unhoused with no fixed address) registered
at the Long Haul office on Shattuck. Useful for mailing but not for in-person
contacts.

##############################################################################
### Bar graphs for data analysis
##############################################################################
Generated plots

2020 election data plots for comparison/projection
 Note that there are several current voters who were of voting age in the 2020
 presidential election but were not registered to vote until later. These have
 the status of NA (not eligible) for the 2020 election and may indicate an
 opportunity to register first-time voters this time around. This should be
 especially true for district 7 now that they don't have a council representative,
 but we also notice high numbers for district 4.

2024 plots for extrapolation
 Note that the voter information we received from the registrar of voters is
 from late 2023, so it is three years into the current four-year cycle. We
 would therefore expect that the age 18-22 voter numbers are approximately
 3/4 the value we see in the 2020 election results. These numbers should
 increase over the coming year leading up to the election.

### Moving forward: NGP VAN
##############################################################################

Notes from online reviews:

#####################
* Currency of data:
#####################
First-time voters: our data from the registrar is current as of December. We will need updated info as we get closer to the election since it doesn't reflect voters who come of age this year. The official word from NGP VAN is that the Secretary of State is responsible for updating the underlying data, and VAN will get updated as soon as they get word from the SOS.

From online review:
Cons: That it can FAIL, and FAIL BADLY on election day. I didn't enjoy being screamed at by our Vice Chair because we could NOT chase people via phone who hadn't voted. The data were to update hourly, removing people who had voted, and nope, this did NOT happen. We used a simpler search, and then texted everyone who supposedly hadn't voted (thank you Scale to WIN, which is lovely), with lots of people who responded that "they had voted." BOO!

#####################
*  Cutting turfs:
#####################
Automatic vs manual cutting of turfs. Apparently there are these two ways of cutting turfs in VAN, but it's not clear at this point what the automatic procedure does. Also need to know if manual/automatic cutting can use Census blocks or just precincts. Once PDI implemented cutting of turfs using Census blocks this turned out to be the most efficient way of cutting turfs in PDI. Otherwise using precincts we found ourselves having to manually adjust the street/residence borders.

From online review:
Cons: I struggle with clipping turf in VAN. The process is nonintuitive and difficult. The mapping feature does not give the user enough information to clip turf correctly.

#####################
*  Email:
#####################
Note: that neither VAN nor PDI will produce lists of email addresses, as the email functionality is a paid option for both systems. Emailing in either case requires setting up a unique outgoing email address so it can be monitored for email responses and setting the backend SPF record in the sending email server to avoid spam blacklisting. This isn't a complicated procedure (famous last words, eh?) but it requires administration privileges on the hosting server.

From online review:
Cons: Unfortunately some information is outdated, and the lack of email addresses (especially when so many are registered for VBM and have provided them to the SOE's) and the unreliable phone data is a hindrance.

#####################
* Phone banking: criticism of VAN is that some phone numbers can get out of date, but the phone banking data doesn't reflect the new changes when entered.
#####################

From online review:
Pros: The Virtual Phonebank feature. After the trial and errors of creating script elements prior to actually putting it all together in your final script, being able to launch the phonebank session and send to callers via hyperlink is very convenient. Also, the reports that could be pulled from events, surveys, calls and canvassing made end of campaign reporting not so stressful.

Cons: Bulk uploads are so finicky. If contact phone numbers are not in a particular format they are rejected and causes me clean and re-attempt several times. There is also an inconsistency in the data at times: I will create a list of contacts that were called (Contact Type: phone) and get one number but when I use the report manager sometimes the data doesn't match. I attest to maybe duplicate calls to same phone being shared by different contacts. But that is not the only inconsistency in the data.

#####################
* Training
#####################

From online reviews:
Pros: The data is useful and updated in a timely way. Entering data is adequate, manipulating data is good. (But learning curve to use it is steep.) --- Mini Van is easy for a novice user to begin using it quickly, with little training. Unpaid volunteers are important to campaigns, the software needs to be easy to use to keep them volunteering.
Cons: There is a steep learning curve on how to use NPG VAN. Training is inadequate. To successfully learn to use it needs someone who has been using it to do the individual training, we are counting on the goodwill of others. --- Mini-VAN has trouble with the map function, suddenly all the voters residences often disappear from the map. this happens at least 3 times during a 2 hour canvass. It's frustrating. We rely on unpaid volunteers, any frustration means they may not come and volunteer again.

Cons: It can be difficult to learn. It makes it harder to train new Precinct Chairs when different levels of users see different views of VAN. For example, I do not understand why Precinct Chairs cannot see Scores.

From online review:
Cons: Query features are lacking. Creating queries to share is hard because it doesn't support variables or prompts.

#####################
* Email list sharing:
	Can this be turned off? Sounds like it's on by default.
#####################
From online review:
Cons: I am the potential donor/supporter. Once I pull the switch, I am on NGP VAN's mailing list forever. This list is evidently tied in with Act Blue. I have received as many as 40 solicitations a day with Act Blue's fingerprints on them. I routinely block further solicitations from that candidate no matter how worthwhile the individual's candidacy. I really feel as if I am being manipulated; I hate it.
