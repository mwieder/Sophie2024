Because the csv file received from the registrar of voters has embedded commas
not only in the data but in the column headers as well, all the data columns
after the "care_of" column had erroneous data that prevented any analysis of
election data, residence information, dates, etc. This presented itself in
for example, six extra empty columns and the resulting spread of proper data
into inappropriate columns.

We requested instead a tab-separated (tsv) file but this was not forthcoming
so we embarked on cleaning up the data ourselves. This ended up taking a large
chunk of our time and involved:
	Cleaning the headers (realigning, renaming, deleting unused)
	Cleaning data by manually adjusting missing commas

To create a proper .tsv file after making spreadsheet changes:
Read the .ods file into LibreOffice
Save a Copy... with format .csv
Close the .ods file
Open the .csv file using tab separator *and* check "trim spaces"
Save a copy as .csv (rename to .tsv)

The csv file from the registrar of voters has no district information,
only precincts. In order to map precincts to districts we did the following:

Downloaded three Berkeley district maps from city open data site:
Berkeley-City-Council-Districts.pdf
Berkeley-Voting-Precincts-Map.pdf
CouncilDistrictsE_2018.pdf for historical reference (precinct redistribution)

Manually cross-referenced precincts to districts to create a "district" field in the data
The maps are filed in the "maps" subdirectory

Requested and received legend information from registrar of voters
This explains the ANV etc codes in the csv file.
"HISTORY CODE FOR VOTER HISTORY-2023.pdf"

Found more data cleanup/corrections
country == USA
city == Albany
still more out-of-country embedded commas

Downloaded previous election returns from the registrar of voters:
District 5 2016 and 2020
nov-8-2016-comprehensive-results-report-councilmember-dist5.pdf
District5.2020.results.png
District5.ballots.returned.png
(Note that the registrar of voters mischaracterizes the districts
for the ballots-returned data i.e., district 2, 3, and 5 are labeled 3, 4, and 6)

Downloaded voter information files from the registrar of voters:
c001_g22_registration_by_g22_block20.csv
c001_g22_registration_by_g22_srprec.csv
c001_g22_sr_blk_map.csv
c001_g22_voters_by_g22_block20.csv

### Creation of new fields for analysis
District
Xmail_to
Xreg_at
##############################################################################

Created don't mail and don't contact categories
The out-of-country addresses may be in one of these categories:
 foreign students residing in Berkeley
 Berkeley residents working or studying overseas
The out-of-state addresses are probably similar.
In either case we probably wouldn't bother sending mail.

header: Xmail_to
XC: don't mail - mailing address is out of country
XS: possible don't mail - mailing address is out of state
Don't contact if no physical address

Created apartment category for possible no physical contact
Sophie expressed a desire to exclude apartment buildings from walk lists.

header: Xreg_at
XA: address is in an apartment building
 basis: 10 or more units at an address
 some will be miscategorized, but if we work on the assumption that
 the apartment buildings we missed cancel the ones that aren't apartments
 then we have a ballpark estimate to start the discussion
XN: there is no local address on file
 Note that there are several people registered at the marina.
 These are either at 1/2 Sea Wall or 0/1 University Ave.
 We didn't flag these.
XD: student housing: dorms, student groups

Fixed yet more bad data: street address in apartment # field

VOTER ID 2101934: we changed from 650 Addison (doesn't exist) to 651 Addison
Note: someone is registered at 0 Walnut/Vine St. (Peet's Coffee)
There are several people (assumed unhoused with no fixed address) registered
at the Long Haul office on Shattuck. Useful for mailing but not for in-person
contacts.

### Bar graphs for data analysis

Generated plots

2020 election data plots for comparison/projection
 Note that there are several current voters who were of voting age in the 2020
 presidential election but were not registered to vote until later. These have
 the status of NA (not eligible) for the 2020 election and may indicate an
 opportunity to register first-time voters this time around.

2024 plots for extrapolation
 Note that the voter information we received from the registrar of voters is
 from late 2023, so it is three years into the current four-year cycle. We
 would therefore expect that the age 18-22 voter numbers are approximately
 3/4 the value we see in the 2020 election results. These numbers should
 increase over the coming year leading up to the election.
